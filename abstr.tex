Integer errors have emerged as a threat to systems security,
because they allow exploits such as buffer overflow
and privilege escalation.
%
This paper presents \sys, a static analysis tool that detects
integer errors in C programs.  It generates predicates
from source code and user annotations, and feeds them into
a constraint solver for deciding whether integer error is possible.
%
\sys identified \nrbugs integer errors in the Linux kernel,
the lighttpd web server, and OpenSSH, which were confirmed
and fixed by the developers.
%
Based on the experience with \sys, the paper further proposes a
new integer family with NaN semantics to help developers avoid
integer errors in C programs.
