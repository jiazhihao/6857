Integer errors have emerged as a threat to systems security,
which allow further exploits such as buffer overflow
and privilege escalation.
%
This paper presents \sys, a static analysis tool that detects
integer errors in systems code.  It generates Boolean constraints
from source code and user annotations, and feeds them into
a solver for deciding satisfiability.
%
\sys has found more than 60 integer errors in the Linux kernel, the
lighttpd web server, and OpenSSH, all of which have been confirmed
and fixed upstream.
