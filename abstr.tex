Integer errors have emerged as a threat to systems security,
because they allow further exploits such as buffer overflow
and privilege escalation.
%
This paper presents \sys, a static analysis tool that detects
integer errors in systems code.  It generates predicates
from source code and user annotations, and feeds them into
a constraint solver for deciding satisfiability.
%
\sys identified more than 60 integer errors in the Linux kernel,
the lighttpd web server, and OpenSSH, which were confirmed
and fixed by the developers.
