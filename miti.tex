\section{Mitigation}
\label{s:miti}

This section discusses mitigate stratigies for integer errors in
software.

\subsection{Compiler Checking}

It would be useful to have the compiler check and warn against
integer errors, so that dvelopers can easily notice these bugs and
fix them at compile time.  Ideally, the check should not slow down
the compilation too much, and the false rate should be kept low,
so that developers are willing to enable the check.

Due to the above two concerns, it is unlikely to directly integrate
our solver-based approach into a compiler.  A pragmatic workaround
could be to match and warn against the common error patterns
summarized in \autoref{s:eval:common}, which can be done efficiently
with a low false rate.

Decent C compilers have some support for detecting integer error
patterns.
%
GCC provides \cc{-Wtype-limits} to warn if a comparison if always
true or false due to type range limits.
%however this
%option is not turned on even with \cc{-Wall}, probably because of
%its high false rate.
%
Clang has a similar option called \cc{-Wtautological-compare}.

We test these features by running latest versions of both compilers
against three simple error patterns extracted from the bugs discovered
by \sys.  The result as shown in \autoref{f:cmp-stat}.  GCC cannot
find any of them with \cc{-Wall}; it can find two with \cc{-Wextra}
or \cc{-Wtype-limits}, but these options are usually turned off by
developers due to high false rate.  Clang can find one of them
without any special option.
%
%Neither of the compilers can detect the third error pattern, which
%is simply a variation of the second one.
%
We plan to push our work on integer error patterns into these C
compilers and improve their compile-time checking mechanism.

error patterns.  GCC can detect two, but only when \cc{-Wextra} is
given.  Clang can detect one without any special option.}

\subsection{Run-Time Checking}

The grsecurity~\cite{grsecurity} patch, aiming to enhance the
security of the Linux kernel, addresses the integer error issue
in \cc{kmalloc} calls by defining a macro of the same name.
%
\input{code/grsecurity-kmalloc}
%
Here \cc{intoverflow_t} is defined as the 128-bit unsigned integer
type.  The trick is that, assuming the developer often writes code
like \cc{kmalloc(n * sizeof(...))}, with the macro of the same name
the C preprocessor will silently change the call to
\cc{kmalloc((intoverflow_t)n * sizeof(...))}, where \cc{n} is first
promoted to 128 bits for the computation.  This should be large
enough to detect most integer errors.  However, it does not work
if the allocation size is already computed before being passed to
\cc{kmalloc}, such as in \autoref{f:bridge}.

when writing your own allocator, don't repeat the mistake that
happened in glibc and Microsoft's libc~\cite{rus-cert:calloc}.

\subsection{Using an Integer Library}

One approach to secure the code is to enforce the use of an integer library
with overflow checks. [[[ examples: ms's libs ]]]
However, developers have to (re)write their
code using library functions like $\cc{addsl}(x, y)$ rather than
intuitive arithmetic operators like $x + y$ for addition of two signed
long integers.

Developers also have to make sure that the integer library itself
is implemented correctly.  Below is the implementation of \cc{addsl}
in CERT's IntegerLib.
%
\input{code/addsl}
%
We believe the code is broken in two ways. First, \cc{sizeof(int)}
should be \cc{sizeof(signed long)}, otherwise the code would
trigger false alarms on a 64-bit system.  Second, \cc{addsl}
(as well as other \cc{adds}* functions)
relies on undefined behavior, i.e., signed overflow of \cc{lhs+rhs},
to defend against overflow.  This would case [[[cite]]].  Also other
library bugs in Mozilla.

\subsection{Language Design}

We believe that removing unsigned types from the language does not
help.  For example, Java only supports signed integers.  However,
its binary search implementation contained an integer bug, which
was not fixed until JDK~6~\cite{java-bsearch}.  The buggy code
calculates the midpoint using $(\cc{low} + \cc{high})/2$, which
will become negative for large $\cc{low}$ and $\cc{high}$.  A correct
version is $\cc{low} + (\cc{high}-\cc{low})/2$.  In the C language
one may simply declare $\cc{low}$ and $\cc{high}$ as unsigned
integers to avoid the problem.

Scripting languages such as Python and Ruby have built-in bignum,
i.e., infinitely ranged integer.  Though sacrificing performance,
using bignum is generally more immune to integer errors since bignum
does not wrap.
%
However, the underlying bignum implementation itself, often written
in C, may contain vulnerabilities.  A recent example in Ruby
(CVE-2011-0188) is due to improper integer truncation, where using
a large bignum value may cause a buffer overflow.

range annotations?  something like?
\begin{Verbatim}
#define RANGE(lo, hi) __attribute__((range(lo, hi)))
#define MAX_ELTS 1024

struct X {
	unsigned int nelts RANGE(1, MAX_ELTS);
	struct Y *elts;
};
\end{Verbatim}
Then you can do instrumentation on stores of nelts.
Better runtime checks \& good for static analysis.
