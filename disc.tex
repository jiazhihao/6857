\subsection{Common Pitfalls}

miss sanitation

char$\to$int: 
CA-1996-22,
Apache,
lighttpd's new bug


bad overflow checks: $x \times y < x$, 
\autoref{f:bridge}

\subsection{Mitigation Strategies}

malloc $\to$ calloc

type promotion

The grsecurity~\cite{grsecurity} patch, aiming to enhance the
security of the Linux kernel, addresses the integer error issue
in \cc{kmalloc} calls by defining a macro of the same name.
%
\input{code/grsecurity-kmalloc}
%
Here \cc{intoverflow_t} is defined as the 128-bit unsigned integer
type.  The trick is that, assuming the developer often writes code
like \cc{kmalloc(n * sizeof(...))}, with the macro of the same name
the C preprocessor will silently change the call to
\cc{kmalloc((intoverflow_t)n * sizeof(...))}, where \cc{n} is first
promoted to 128 bits for the computation.  This should be large
enough to detect most integer errors.  However, it does not work
if the allocation size is already computed before being passed to
\cc{kmalloc}, such as in \autoref{f:bridge}.

when writing your own allocator, don't repeat the mistake that
happened in glibc and Microsoft's libc~\cite{rus-cert:calloc}.

separate error code with bad values

using a library? language support?

compiler support: warn common error patterns,
path validation.

range annotations? use bit fields to limit the value?
