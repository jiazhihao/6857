Integer errors have emerged as a threat to system security. A 2007
study of the CVE list~\cite{christey:vuln} suggests that they ``are
number 2 for OS vendor advisories''.  A recent survey~\cite{chen:kbugs}
confirms the finding, where integer errors account for more than
one third of the reported Linux kernel vulnerabilities from 2010
to early 2011 that can be misused to corrupt the kernel and break
its integrity.

Integer errors:
arithmetic overflow,
division-by-zero,
oversized shift, and
signedness bugs.
