\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:concl}

This paper describes \sys, a static analysis tool that detects
integer errors in systems code.  It proposes a pragmatic integer
semantics and a set of effective optimizations for constraint
solving.  Applying \sys to the Linux kernel, the lighttpd web server,
and OpenSSH results in more than 60 bugs fixed upstream.
