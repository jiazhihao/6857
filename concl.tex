\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:concl}

This paper describes the design and implementation of \sys, a static
analysis tool that identified and aided to fix \nrbugs integer
errors in the Linux kernel, the lighttpd web server, and OpenSSH\@.
Our experience shows that integer errors are prevalent in system software,
often due to unanticipated integer wraparound caused by values from
untrusted inputs.  We hope that NaN integers can help mitigate the
issue in practice.
