\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:concl}

This paper describes the design and implementation of \sys, a static analysis
tool that identified and aided in fixing \nrbugs integer errors in the Linux
kernel, the lighttpd web server, and OpenSSH\@.  A common integer error is
unanticipated integer wraparound caused by values from untrusted inputs.  We
hope that the NaN integers we propose can mitigate that problem in the future.
