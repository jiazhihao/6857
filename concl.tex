\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:concl}

This paper describes \sys, a static analysis tool that detects
integer errors in C code.  It proposes a pragmatic integer
semantics and effective predicate generation algorithms.
We applied \sys to the Linux kernel, the lighttpd web server, and
OpenSSH, and fixed more than 60 integer errors in them.
