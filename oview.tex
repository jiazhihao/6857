\section{Overview}
\label{s:oview}

This paper assumes two's complement integers~\cite{intel:int}, a
de facto standard representation in modern computer systems.  It
uses $n$ bits to represent either unsigned integers in the range
$0$ to $2^n-1$, or signed integers in the range $-2^{n-1}$ to
$2^{n-1}-1$, with the most significant bit indicating the sign.

\subsection{Integer Semantics}

what are considered to be correct/wrong?

\subsection{A Strawman Approach}

describe a strawman solution:
generate path conditions and integer constraints,
and feed into a solver.

\subsection{Challenges}

type conversion: too many FPs;

pointer arithmetic.

overflow checking idioms.

loops.

solver performance.
